Question: Why does market fragmentation work for airline industry but could't work for Airbnb
Human Answer: Even though both the airline industry and airbnb have a global geographical presence the airline operators working on a global scale have different requirements so do local and regional operators leading to different required infrastructure hence market fragmentation becomes important
Generated Answer: Market fragmentation works because airlines operate on a highly standardized and regulated platform (air traffic control, airport infrastructure), making it easier to compare prices across different airlines. In contrast, Airbnb operates in a more complex and decentralized market with many players offering similar services.

Airbnb's complexity arises from the fact that there are thousands of hosts worldwide, each with their own pricing strategy, amenities, and target audience. This makes it difficult for users to find the best deal or compare prices across different listings.

Additionally, Airbnb's platform is not as tightly regulated as airlines', which can lead to price gouging and other issues.
