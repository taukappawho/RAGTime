Question: According to Information Theory, what is the importance of knowing what message your sender is trying to convey?
Human Answer: The more closely the actual communication is to the expected message the 'noisier' the transmission medium can be and the less important gain is.
Generated Answer: According to Information Theory, the importance of knowing what message your sender is trying to convey lies in the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which describes the relationship between signal and medium. The theorem states that the bandwidth required for a given level of signal quality depends on both the frequency of the signal and the noise level in the medium.

In simpler terms, if you want to send a message with minimal interference (low noise), you need to use a higher frequency signal. Conversely, if you want to minimize interference, you should use a lower frequency signal.
