Human Answer: Even though both the airline industry and airbnb have a global geographical presence the airline operators working on a global scale have different requirements so do local and regional operators leading to different required infrastructure hence market fragmentation becomes important

In contrast, Airbnb is a global network with a single platform serving travelers worldwide, making it difficult to fragment the market in the same way as airlines. The global nature of travel and the need for a unified platform make fragmentation less viable for Airbnb.

Human Answer: Even though both the airline industry and airbnb have a global geographical presence the airline operators working on a global scale have different requirements so do local and regional operators leading to different required infrastructure hence market fragmentation becomes important

In contrast, Airbnb is a global network with a single platform serving travelers worldwide, making it difficult to fragment the market in the same way as airlines. The global nature of travel and the need for a unified platform make fragmentation less viable for Airbnb.
