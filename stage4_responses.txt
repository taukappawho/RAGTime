Question: Why does market fragmentation work for airline industry but could't work for Airbnb
Human Answer: Even though both the airline industry and airbnb have a global geographical presence the airline operators working on a global scale have different requirements so do local and regional operators leading to different required infrastructure hence market fragmentation becomes important
Generated Answer: Market fragmentation works for the airline industry because it creates cornered resources, making it difficult for consumers to switch between airlines. This leads to high switching costs and resource lock-in, which allows airlines to maintain a strong market position despite increased competition. In contrast, Airbnb's business model relies on network effects, but its dual-sided platform makes it easier for users to switch between hosts and guests, reducing the effectiveness of cornered resources as a competitive advantage.

Row 42:
Question: What Percentage of Rent to Sales did Sam Waltons first Ben Franklin cost
Human Answer: 5%
Generated Answer: The question is not directly answered in the provided chunks, but it can be inferred that the store's operating margin on sales was 24%, which translates to a rent-to-sales ratio. Assuming the $30,000 annual profit and $250,000 sales revenue, we can calculate the rent as follows:

Rent = Sales x (1 - Operating Margin)
= $250,000 x (1 - 0.24)
= $187,500

The original purchase price was $25,000, so the initial rent-to-sales ratio would be:

Rent-to-Sales Ratio = Rent / Sales
= $187,500 / $
